# Threat Hunt Report: Insider Threat

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Bash

## Scenario

Management has raised concerns about a recent rise in threat actors targeting outdated software with known vulnerabilities, which could compromise company systems. These vulnerabilities are often exploited through outdated versions of software that employees may still be using, whether knowingly or unknowingly. Security teams have detected that several internal machines may be running outdated software, and there's a risk that these versions could be exploited by malicious actors. Management has requested a comprehensive review to identify and confirm any instances of outdated software in use across the organization.

The objective is to detect and analyze the usage of outdated software with known vulnerabilities, assess the potential security risks across multiple systems, and ensure that all software being used within the organization is up to date and secure.

## High-Level IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for modifications to software installation files, directories, and configuration files related to outdated software.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for suspicious executions of outdated software or any software associated with known vulnerabilities.
- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for unusual network activity made by the outdated software or suspicious outbound connections.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Searched for processes running on the network, looking for any machines that were running outdated versions of software. Some suspicious traffic was discovered and the scope of the search was narrowed down to pinpoint this traffic by `Timestamp`, a suspicious process running on `DeviceName` **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"** ran by `AccountName` **"baddog"** was found.

At **Feb 3, 2025 10:07:30 AM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.39.tar.gz
```

This command downloads Apache HTTP Server 2.4.39, an outdated and vulnerable version of the Apache HTTP Server.

At **Feb 3, 2025 10:25:33 AM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

This command starts the Apache HTTP Server service.

This confirms the installation and execution of an outdated software, furthermore a version that has several well known vulnerabilites.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tar" or ProcessCommandLine contains "make" or ProcessCommandLine contains "apt-get" 
  or ProcessCommandLine contains "rpm" or ProcessCommandLine contains "wget" or ProcessCommandLine contains "curl"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc

DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tar" or ProcessCommandLine contains "make" or ProcessCommandLine contains "apt-get" 
  or ProcessCommandLine contains "rpm" or ProcessCommandLine contains "wget" or ProcessCommandLine contains "curl"
| where Timestamp >= ago(2h) and Timestamp < ago(1h)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc

DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tar" or ProcessCommandLine contains "make" or ProcessCommandLine contains "apt-get" 
  or ProcessCommandLine contains "rpm" or ProcessCommandLine contains "wget" or ProcessCommandLine contains "curl"
| where AccountName == "baddog"
| where Timestamp >= ago(2h) and Timestamp < ago(1h)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceLogonEvents` Table

Searched for any `AccountName` that was not "baddog" to detect unauthorized SSH logins.

At **Feb 2, 2025 3:15:01 PM**, the user **"root"** logged into the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"** via **Network logon type**, indicating a remote SSH connection.

This suggests that a backdoor mechanism was used to gain unauthorized root access.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where AccountName != "baddog"  // Look for unexpected SSH logins
| where LogonType in ("RemoteInteractive", "Network")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, RemoteIP, LogonType
```

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for Malicious Systemd Service Execution

**Objective:** Detect the creation or execution of a malicious systemd service for persistence.

At **Feb 2, 2025 3:12:10 PM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
sudo systemctl start malicious.service
```

This action started a malicious systemd service designed to maintain persistent access to the system.

The service was created earlier by the user with the following command:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/malicious.service
```

This confirms that the systemd service malicious.service was set up as a means of ensuring the attacker could regain access if necessary.


**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "malicious.service"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
```

### 4. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for Trojanized `ls` Execution

**Objective:** Detect the execution of a Trojanized script (`ls`) used to maintain unauthorized access.

At **Feb 2, 2025 4:00:13 PM**, the user **"baddog"** executed the following command on the device **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"**:
```
~/.local/bin/ls
```
This command runs a Trojanized version of the `ls` utility, which was replaced by a script that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine. This action indicates the attempt to maintain access by running malicious scripts under the guise of a common administrative command.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
// Detect execution of Trojanized 'ls' command
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "/home/baddog/.local/bin/ls"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine 
```

## Summary

The user "baddog" on the device "thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net" took deliberate actions to establish persistence and gain unauthorized root access. Initially, the attacker created a malicious backdoor binary (`/tmp/rootbash`) and modified its ownership to `root`. Following this, the attacker set the SUID permission on the binary, allowing any user to execute it with root privileges, effectively escalating their access. The attacker then executed the backdoor to confirm the privilege escalation.

To ensure persistent access, the attacker created and enabled a **malicious systemd service** (`malicious.service`) which would automatically start the backdoor on system boot. Additionally, a **Trojanized `ls` command** was placed in the user's home directory (`~/.local/bin/ls`), which was executed to establish a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine.

These actions suggest that the user "baddog" was attempting to establish a **backdoor and maintain persistent root access** on the system, bypassing security controls and potentially preparing for further unauthorized activities.

---

## Response Taken

Unauthorized root access and backdoor activities were confirmed on the endpoint **"thlinux.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net"** by the user **"baddog"**. The device was isolated, the backdoor and associated persistence mechanisms were disabled, and the user's direct manager was notified. Further investigation and remediation are underway to assess any potential data exfiltration or other malicious actions.
